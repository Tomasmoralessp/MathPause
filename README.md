# MathPause

MathPause is a cross-platform app that proposes a math challenge before accessing social media. This project is being developed collaboratively by @MIGUELBACHILLERGH55 and myself, @tomasmoralessp. The goal of this project has two main aspects: first, to reduce the time spent on social media; and second, to provide a fun, easy-to-use tool that relies on spaced repetition techniques to study, practice, and improve mathematical skills.
 

## Features

- Offers a variety of math challenges, including integrals and derivatives.
- Can be customized to adjust the difficulty of the problems.
- Supports both Android and iOS platforms using React Native.
